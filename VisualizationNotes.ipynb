    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Starting Materials\n",
    "- The third tab in the Data Mining Hackathon spreadsheet (in this folder, not linked in the notebook due to issues with linking) is the EPA Strategic Goals\n",
    "- Use that tab for examples of what I'm describing below, but I am trying to give an overview that does not exist in the spreadsheet!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The gist of the problem\n",
    "- These goals are from 2020 and from 2014.\n",
    "- These goals fall into a set of subject areas - they are not contiguous in the spreadsheet, roughly:\n",
    "  - Air Quality (CAA - Clean Air Act)\n",
    "  - Water Quality (CWA - Clean Water Act)\n",
    "  - Toxic Substance Releases into the environment (TSCA)\n",
    "  - Toxic Chemical Inventory (FIFRA)\n",
    "  - Superfund Sites (CERCLA)\n",
    "  - Brownfield Sites - think ugly block inside of a city\n",
    "  - Leaking Unerground Storage Tanks (LUST)\n",
    "  - Others too, just not listing all here\n",
    "- For each of these there are metrics about things like\n",
    "  - Permit processes - when applied for, when granted, etc\n",
    "  - Accidental Leaks (water, air, superfund sites - all apply)\n",
    "  - How many \"things\" (superfund sites, brownfield sites) are \"ready for use\" (we've finished cleaning them up) - think of these as following a \"cleanup process\"  \n",
    "- For each of the metrics, there are \"dimensions\" to think about\n",
    "  - Date/Time range\n",
    "  - In compliance vs out of compliance\n",
    "  - Subject Area - mentioned above\n",
    "- The best single page explaining all of these is [here](https://www.epa.gov/compliance/compliance-monitoring-programs)\n",
    "- Once you dig in to this page you will see that most of the compliance areas have their own applications and databases that do the tracking for the EPA.  Very typical - they probably built each app separately when that law came into effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The standard solution\n",
    "- A Metrics Scorecard\n",
    "- At all times shows:\n",
    "  - A set of metrics\n",
    "  - Their results across time\n",
    "  - Choice boxes to change the dimensions above - change Subject Area from Air Metrics to Water Metrics, change time frame, etc.\n",
    "- Under the covers there is usually:\n",
    "  - Raw Data from each source, in case the drill downs from the scorecard require full detail\n",
    "  - Integrated data stores - the \"Event Lifecycle\" or the \"Accidental Emissions\" - can be generalized so that you can show the emissions whether they are Air/Water/Superfund, etc.  \n",
    "  - Metric data stores - take the integrated data and transform it into the metrics and lay it out (usually a flat table, or a star schema if the reporting tool works with that) - so that the metrics and all the dimensional data are together for a single day - or some structure like that.\n",
    "  - Some metric definition glossary that the user interface can use when it needs\n",
    "  - The scorecard itself - pulling from the above sources.  The scorecard would typically be done with Tableau or QlikView or PowerBI these days, or COGNOS, Web Focus, Business Objects - in older days.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Our problem - the standard solution is too boring to bother entering into a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Options to do something unique\n",
    "\n",
    "### The standard solution with all open source components\n",
    "- I think this is too hard for the time we have.\n",
    "- But the motivation - I'm glad you brought up Tableau the other day\n",
    "- Paying for Enterprise Software drove me crazy at certain times in the last 20 years.  And not being able to release a visualization to 1000's of employees without a big fat license cost - really constrained our solutions.\n",
    "- And so for enterprises - a standard methodology and toolset for doing scorecards with open source - would be very valuable.\n",
    "- But for our audience of the Data Visualization Society - this is not very exciting.\n",
    "- So between too hard, and not directed at the Data Viz Society audience - this probably isn't a good idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drama via heat maps and geographic maps\n",
    "- A standard scorecard has little excitement in it.\n",
    "- In other words, people may not pay enough attention to it.\n",
    "  (Aside - in the big company they paid lots of attention if they had a bonus based on a metric - and management often did this - so you needed usable displays of information, they didn't have to be exciting).\n",
    "- And so when I saw great data visualizations, I had two thoughts:\n",
    "  - Wow, how cool - what a great way to make that point\n",
    "  - But no one is going to watch this time lapse video every day.  They need to get quickly to the metric they are trying to improve.  So these super cool visualization techniques aren't good for every day work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A \"different\" visualization technique for process flow diagrams\n",
    "- So we need to combine the utility of the standard scorecard with the cool/wow factor of the newer data visualization techniques.\n",
    "- (Making this up, we have to study the actual EPA data)\n",
    "- We could create a process diagram\n",
    "  - Step 1 - Fill out form abc\n",
    "  - Step 2 - Form gets reviewed approval goes to Step 3, rejection back to Step 1\n",
    "  - Step 3 - Requestor now carries out whatever they got permission for\n",
    "  - Step 4 - the Request is closed out\n",
    "- Now, we could \n",
    "  - Put the dynamic numbers on it - 327 forms are on step 2, 193 requests are currently being worked\n",
    "  - Put the choice boxes around it - geography, time dimension, which process so you could change to look at a different process.\n",
    "- I really think this could be a great way of doing process oriented scorecards and so I think this has a lot of potential for us."

    "- Coming out, we would have flows to air, land and water (all visuals)\n",
    "- We would show amounts on the output flows, probably a total amount (in the pipe visually)?\n",
    "- We would try to make the amount show visually with thinner/thicker streams of stuff\n",
    "- Again these are big totals that get refined down to smaller ones as the user chooses.\n",
    "- When an individual row is reached, we will want some additional capabilities\n",
    "  - popups or extra windows\n",
    "  - with as much info as we can get about the incident\n",
    "  - and links to the rest\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Option 2 - US Map Based\n",
    "- User choice stuff all generally applies\n",
    "- We would be doing totals a lot, but here, we would be able to show many individual incidents at once\n",
    "- We should be able to show relative size here also, but the large scale of the map might make that tough\n",
